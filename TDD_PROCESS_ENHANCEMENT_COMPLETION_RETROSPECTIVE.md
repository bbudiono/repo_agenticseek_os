### üîß Test Infrastructure Fixes

#### Provider System Testing
```python
# Before: Mock dictionary objects
mock_providers = {'gpt4': 'mock_provider'}

# After: Proper Provider objects with full constructor
mock_providers = {
    'gpt4': Provider('test', 'gpt-4-mock', is_local=True),
    'claude': Provider('test', 'claude-3-opus-mock', is_local=True)
}
```

#### Error Handling Enhancement
```python
# Added retry mechanisms for flaky tests
max_retries = 3 if test_name == "Health Check" else 1
timeout = 15.0 if test_name == "Health Check" else 10.0

for attempt in range(max_retries):
    try:
        response = await client.get(url, timeout=timeout)
        break
    except Exception as retry_e:
        if attempt == max_retries - 1:
            raise retry_e
        await asyncio.sleep(1)
```

#### Integration Test Sophistication
```python
# Enhanced workflow validation with step tracking
workflow_steps = []
# Multi-step validation: health_check, query_endpoint, 
# structured_response, latest_answer, answer_validation
workflow_success = len(workflow_steps) >= 3
```
