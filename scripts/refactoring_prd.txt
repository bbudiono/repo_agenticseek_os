# Product Requirements Document: AgenticSeek UI/UX Refactoring

## 1. Introduction
This document outlines the requirements for refactoring the AgenticSeek UI/UX codebase to address identified areas for improvement, as detailed in the recent comprehensive code review. The primary goal is to enhance code quality, ensure strict adherence to the defined Design System and UI/UX standards, improve error handling, and eliminate hardcoded values.

## 2. Scope of Refactoring

### 2.1 Eliminate Hardcoded Values
All instances of hardcoded strings, magic numbers, direct color values (e.g., hex codes, RGB), and direct font definitions throughout the codebase MUST be replaced with references to constants defined in the `DesignSystem.swift` file. This applies to, but is not limited to:
*   Colors (e.g., `#2563EB`, `Color(red: 0.1, green: 0.2, blue: 0.3)`)
*   Typography (e.g., `Font.system(size: 16)`, `Font.custom("Inter", size: 14)`)
*   Spacing (e.g., `padding(10)`, `frame(width: 20)`)
*   Corner Radii (e.g., `cornerRadius(8)`)
*   Arbitrary string literals used for UI labels, messages, or identifiers that should be externalized.

### 2.2 Enhance Error Handling
Implement robust and consistent error handling mechanisms across all modules, especially in areas involving external service interactions (e.g., network calls to LLMs, Docker service management, API key validation). This includes:
*   Implementing clear, user-friendly error messages in the UI for recoverable errors.
*   Logging detailed technical error information securely for debugging purposes.
*   Ensuring graceful degradation when services are unavailable or interactions fail.
*   Utilizing Swift's `Error` protocol and custom error types where appropriate.

### 2.3 Ensure UI/UX Compliance
Systematically review and refactor UI components and views to ensure strict compliance with the `AgenticSeek UI/UX Cursor Rules` (Version 1.0, Last Updated: May 31, 2025). This includes:
*   Verifying all UI elements (colors, typography, spacing, corner radii) explicitly reference `DesignSystem` constants.
*   Ensuring accessibility requirements are met (e.g., minimum touch targets, screen reader support, keyboard navigation).
*   Validating proper implementation of agent identification (color coding, visual hierarchy), privacy indicators (local/cloud processing), and code execution interfaces (syntax highlighting, status indicators).
*   Confirming adherence to animation standards and performance considerations.

### 2.4 Improve Code Documentation
Enhance inline code documentation for all significant code sections, complex logic, non-obvious decisions, and public-facing APIs. This involves:
*   Adding `///` Swift DocC comments for all public and open APIs.
*   Adding `//` comments for complex internal logic, rationale behind design choices, and business rules.
*   Updating existing comments to be more detailed, clear, and concise.

### 2.5 Reinforce Test Coverage
While not a direct code refactoring task, ensure that sufficient unit, integration, and UI tests are in place or created to validate the refactored components and new functionalities. Prioritize:
*   Unit tests for refactored logic in ViewModels and utility functions.
*   UI tests for critical user flows and visual regressions introduced by refactoring.
*   Integration tests for interactions between refactored modules.

## 3. Goals & Objectives
*   **Improve Code Maintainability**: Reduce technical debt and make the codebase easier to understand, modify, and extend.
*   **Enhance UI/UX Consistency**: Ensure a cohesive and polished user experience by strictly adhering to the defined design system.
*   **Increase Application Robustness**: Implement comprehensive error handling to make the application more resilient to failures.
*   **Boost Developer Productivity**: Provide clearer code and better error diagnostics for future development.

## 4. Non-Goals
*   Introduction of new major features not specified in existing `BLUEPRINT.MD`.
*   Major architectural changes (beyond refactoring within existing patterns).

## 5. Success Metrics
*   All hardcoded values identified in the code review are replaced by `DesignSystem` constants.
*   Error handling mechanisms are demonstrably improved and cover critical failure points.
*   UI/UX compliance is verified against `AgenticSeek UI/UX Cursor Rules` through visual inspection and automated checks.
*   Increase in code coverage for affected modules post-refactoring (measured by existing test suite, or new tests if added).
*   Reduction in reported UI/UX inconsistencies and runtime errors.
