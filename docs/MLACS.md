# Multi-LLM Agent Coordination System (MLACS) Design Document

## Introduction
This document outlines the design and implementation plan for a Multi-LLM Agent Coordination System (MLACS). MLACS is designed to enable seamless collaboration between multiple language models to solve complex tasks by leveraging their diverse capabilities and fostering inter-model communication and thought sharing. This system aims to provide a platform-agnostic solution that enhances problem-solving efficiency, accuracy, and comprehensiveness compared to single-LLM approaches.

## System Architecture & Core Requirements

### 1. Multi-LLM Orchestration Engine

### 2. LLM Relationship Models
This section defines two distinct operational modes for LLM collaboration.

- Hierarchical task delegation with quality oversight
- Master model reviews and synthesizes worker outputs

**Peer-to-Peer Architecture**:
- Multiple frontier models working as equals
- Collaborative decision-making and consensus building
