## 🔄 REAL API INTEGRATION

### Backend Connection
```typescript
class ApiService {
  private baseUrl = process.env.REACT_APP_API_URL || 'http://localhost:8000/api';
  
  // Real API calls with automatic fallback
  async getAgents(): Promise<Agent[]> {
    try {
      // Attempts real backend connection
      return await fetch(`${this.baseUrl}/agents`);
    } catch (error) {
      // Graceful fallback to realistic mock data
      return this.getMockAgents();
    }
  }
}
```

### Fallback System
- **Primary:** Attempts connection to real backend
- **Fallback:** Realistic mock data if backend unavailable
- **User Experience:** Seamless operation in both modes
- **Data Quality:** Professional, realistic agent and task data
