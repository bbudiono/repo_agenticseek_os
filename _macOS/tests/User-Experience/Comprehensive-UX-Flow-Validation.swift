//
// FILE-LEVEL TEST REVIEW & RATING
//
// Purpose: Comprehensive user journey, onboarding, and stress scenario validation for AgenticSeek.
//
// Issues & Complexity: This suite simulates real user flows, including onboarding, expert workflows, and error recovery under stress. It measures not just technical correctness but also user satisfaction, efficiency, and resilience. The tests are scenario-driven and difficult to game, as they require the product to deliver real value and usability.
//
// Ranking/Rating:
// - Coverage: 9/10 (Covers critical user journeys and edge cases)
// - Realism: 9/10 (Tests are based on actual user personas and tasks)
// - Usefulness: 9/10 (Directly tied to user success and product adoption)
// - Reward Hacking Risk: Low (Tests require genuine UX improvements, not just passing values)
//
// Overall Test Quality Score: 9/10
//
// Summary: This file exemplifies best practices in user-centric test design. It is highly effective at preventing reward hacking, as passing requires real improvements in onboarding, workflow efficiency, and error recovery. Recommend regular updates to reflect evolving user needs and new features.

                     FIRST-TIME USER REQUIREMENTS:
                     • Zero-knowledge assumption: No prior AI experience needed
                     • Progressive disclosure: Show only essential options initially
                     • Clear value proposition: User understands benefit immediately
                     • Guided discovery: Natural progression through interface
                     • Quick wins: Success within first 2 minutes
                     
                     CRITICAL ONBOARDING FAILURES:
                     • No guided introduction to AI capabilities
                     • Overwhelming model selection without context
                     • Technical configuration exposed too early
                     • No example conversations or prompts
                     • Success unclear (when has user "succeeded"?)
                     
                     REQUIRED ONBOARDING IMPROVEMENTS:
                     • Add welcome screen with value proposition
                     • Implement guided tutorial for first conversation
                     • Provide example prompts and conversation starters
                     • Hide advanced configuration until needed
                     • Show clear success indicators and next steps
                     
                     ONBOARDING FLOW DESIGN:
                     1. Welcome screen: "Chat with AI - Get instant help with any task"
                     2. Quick start: Pre-configured setup with default model
                     3. Example prompts: "Ask me to write an email" / "Help me code"
                     4. First success: Clear feedback when conversation works
                     5. Progressive features: Reveal advanced options gradually
                     
                     USER IMPACT:
                     • High abandonment rate for new users
                     • Poor first impression and product perception
