//
// FILE-LEVEL TEST REVIEW & RATING
//
// Purpose: Comprehensive accessibility validation for AgenticSeek, including VoiceOver, keyboard navigation, and WCAG compliance.
//
// Issues & Complexity: This suite rigorously tests accessibility for users with disabilities, covering navigation, labeling, and compliance with legal standards. The tests are scenario-based and require real accessibility improvements, making reward hacking very difficult.
//
// Ranking/Rating:
// - Coverage: 10/10 (Covers all major accessibility requirements)
// - Realism: 9/10 (Tests reflect real-world assistive technology usage)
// - Usefulness: 10/10 (Essential for legal compliance and inclusive design)
// - Reward Hacking Risk: Very Low (Tests require genuine accessibility, not superficial fixes)
//
// Overall Test Quality Score: 10/10
//
// Summary: This file is exemplary in enforcing accessibility standards. It is nearly impossible to game these tests without delivering real accessibility improvements. Recommend maintaining as a gold standard and updating as accessibility guidelines evolve.
