//
// FILE-LEVEL TEST REVIEW & RATING
//
// Purpose: Comprehensive content quality, error messaging, and microcopy consistency tests for AgenticSeek.
//
// Issues & Complexity: This suite rigorously audits user-facing content for professionalism, clarity, and actionable guidance. It checks for placeholder content, error message quality, microcopy consistency, and inclusive language. The tests are highly aligned with user experience and product credibility, making reward hacking difficult—passing requires real improvements, not superficial fixes.
//
// Ranking/Rating:
// - Coverage: 9/10 (Covers most critical content and messaging areas)
// - Realism: 9/10 (Tests reflect real user impact and professional standards)
// - Usefulness: 9/10 (Directly improves user trust and product quality)
// - Reward Hacking Risk: Low (Tests require genuine content quality, not just passing values)
//
// Overall Test Quality Score: 9/10
//
// Summary: This file sets a high bar for content quality and user communication. It is a model for anti-reward-hacking test design, as it enforces standards that cannot be bypassed with superficial changes. Recommend maintaining and evolving as product language and user needs change.
