## üîß Development Challenges & Solutions

### Challenge 1: Test Interface Compatibility
- **Issue:** Test suite expected different method signatures than initial implementation
- **Root Cause:** TDD approach required matching existing test expectations
- **Solution:** Implemented adaptive interface with backward compatibility
- **Result:** 100% coordinator test compatibility achieved
