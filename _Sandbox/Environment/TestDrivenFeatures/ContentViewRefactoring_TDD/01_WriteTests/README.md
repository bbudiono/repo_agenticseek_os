# ContentViewRefactoring - RED Phase (Write Tests First)

## Objective
Write comprehensive failing tests before any implementation.

## Tasks
1. **Functional Tests**: Core feature functionality validation
2. **Design System Tests**: .cursorrules compliance verification  
3. **User Experience Tests**: User-centric scenario validation
4. **Accessibility Tests**: WCAG AAA compliance testing
5. **Performance Tests**: Performance benchmark validation
6. **Integration Tests**: Component interaction validation

## .cursorrules Compliance Tests Required
- [ ] Color system compliance (DesignSystem.Colors usage)
- [ ] Typography standards (DesignSystem.Typography)
- [ ] Spacing system (4pt grid adherence)
- [ ] Component standards implementation
- [ ] Agent interface requirements
- [ ] Accessibility requirements

## Success Criteria
- All tests fail appropriately (RED state)
- Comprehensive test coverage planned
- Design system validation tests included
- User experience tests with real personas
- Accessibility tests for VoiceOver and keyboard navigation

## Next Phase
Move to 02_ImplementCode when all tests are written and failing.
