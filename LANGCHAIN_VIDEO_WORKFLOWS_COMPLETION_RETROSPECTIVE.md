## Critical Issue Resolution

### Database Connection Pool Issue
**Problem**: Initial test failure with connection pool assertion (2 connections vs expected 3)
**Root Cause**: Database initialization was consuming a connection from the pool
**Solution**: Implemented separate connection for initialization to preserve pool integrity
**Result**: 100% test success rate achieved

### Code Changes Made:
```python
# Fixed initialization to use separate connection
init_conn = sqlite3.connect(
    self.db_path,
    check_same_thread=False,
    timeout=30,
    isolation_level=None
)
# ... initialization logic ...
init_conn.close()  # Preserve pool integrity
```
