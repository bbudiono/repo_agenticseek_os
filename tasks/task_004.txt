# Task ID: 4
# Title: Improve Code Documentation
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: medium
# Description: Enhance inline code documentation for all significant code sections, complex logic, non-obvious decisions, and public-facing APIs using Swift DocC comments and standard inline comments.
# Details:
1. Establish documentation standards:
   - Use `///` Swift DocC comments for all public and open APIs
   - Use `//` comments for complex internal logic, rationale, and business rules
   - Document parameters, return values, throws, and important notes
   - Include code examples where appropriate
   - Document any non-obvious design decisions or business rules

2. Create documentation templates:
```swift
/// A brief description of what this type does.
///
/// A more detailed description that explains the purpose and functionality
/// of this type. Include any important details that would help other developers
/// understand how to use it correctly.
///
/// ## Example Usage
/// ```swift
/// let example = ExampleType()
/// let result = example.doSomething()
/// ```
///
/// - Note: Include any important notes or caveats here.
public struct ExampleType {
    /// A brief description of this property.
    ///
    /// A more detailed description if needed.
    public var someProperty: String
    
    /// Creates a new instance with the specified property value.
    ///
    /// - Parameter someProperty: A description of this parameter.
    public init(someProperty: String) {
        self.someProperty = someProperty
    }
    
    /// Performs some operation and returns a result.
    ///
    /// This method does something specific and returns a result based on
    /// the current state of the instance.
    ///
    /// - Parameters:
    ///   - input: A description of this parameter.
    ///   - flag: A description of this parameter.
    /// - Returns: A description of what is returned.
    /// - Throws: `SomeError.invalidInput` if the input is invalid.
    public func doSomething(with input: String, flag: Bool = false) throws -> Int {
        // Implementation
        return 0
    }
}
```

3. Document key architectural components:
```swift
/// The central service responsible for managing Docker containers.
///
/// `DockerService` handles the lifecycle of Docker containers including:
/// - Starting and stopping containers
/// - Monitoring container health
/// - Managing container resources
/// - Handling container logs
///
/// This service is designed to be a singleton and should be accessed via the `shared` instance.
///
/// ## Example Usage
/// ```swift
/// // Start a container
/// DockerService.shared.startContainer(with: config) { result in
///     switch result {
///     case .success(let containerId):
///         print("Container started with ID: \(containerId)")
///     case .failure(let error):
///         print("Failed to start container: \(error)")
///     }
/// }
/// ```
public class DockerService {
    /// The shared instance of the Docker service.
    public static let shared = DockerService()
    
    // Private implementation details...
    
    /// Starts a Docker container with the specified configuration.
    ///
    /// This method attempts to start a Docker container using the provided configuration.
    /// The operation is performed asynchronously, and the result is delivered through the completion handler.
    ///
    /// - Parameters:
    ///   - configuration: The configuration for the container to start.
    ///   - completion: A closure that is called when the operation completes.
    ///     The closure takes a single argument of type `Result<String, DockerServiceError>`,
    ///     where the success value is the ID of the started container.
    /// - Note: This method requires Docker to be installed and running on the system.
    public func startContainer(with configuration: ContainerConfiguration, completion: @escaping (Result<String, DockerServiceError>) -> Void) {
        // Implementation details...
    }
    
    // Other methods...
}
```

4. Document complex algorithms and business logic:
```swift
/// Calculates the optimal agent selection based on the user's query and available agents.
///
/// This method implements a multi-stage selection algorithm:
/// 1. First, it analyzes the query to determine the primary intent (coding, research, general assistance)
/// 2. Then, it evaluates available agents based on their capabilities and past performance
/// 3. Finally, it selects the most appropriate agent or combination of agents
///
/// The algorithm prioritizes:
/// - Query-agent capability match
/// - Agent historical performance on similar queries
/// - User preferences and past agent interactions
/// - Resource availability
///
/// - Parameters:
///   - query: The user's natural language query
///   - availableAgents: Array of currently available agent instances
///   - userPreferences: The user's saved preferences for agent selection
/// - Returns: The selected agent or agents to handle the query
/// - Throws: `AgentSelectionError` if no suitable agent can be found
func selectOptimalAgent(for query: String, 
                        availableAgents: [Agent], 
                        userPreferences: UserPreferences) throws -> [Agent] {
    // Step 1: Analyze query intent
    let queryIntent = analyzeQueryIntent(query)
    
    // Step 2: Score each agent based on capability match
    var agentScores: [UUID: Double] = [:]
    for agent in availableAgents {
        // Calculate base score from capability match
        var score = calculateCapabilityMatchScore(agent: agent, intent: queryIntent)
        
        // Adjust score based on historical performance
        score *= performanceAdjustmentFactor(agent: agent, intent: queryIntent)
        
        // Apply user preference adjustment
        if userPreferences.preferredAgents.contains(agent.id) {
            score *= 1.2 // 20% boost for preferred agents
        }
        
        agentScores[agent.id] = score
    }
    
    // Step 3: Select top scoring agents
    let sortedAgents = availableAgents.sorted { agentScores[$0.id, default: 0] > agentScores[$1.id, default: 0] }
    
    // If no agent scores above minimum threshold, throw error
    guard let topAgent = sortedAgents.first, 
          agentScores[topAgent.id, default: 0] >= 0.5 else {
        throw AgentSelectionError.noSuitableAgentFound
    }
    
    // For complex queries that benefit from multiple agents, return top 2-3 agents
    if queryIntent.complexity > 0.8 && sortedAgents.count >= 2 {
        return Array(sortedAgents.prefix(queryIntent.requiresMultipleAgents ? 3 : 1))
    }
    
    return [topAgent]
}

// Helper function to analyze query intent
private func analyzeQueryIntent(_ query: String) -> QueryIntent {
    // Implementation details...
    // This uses NLP techniques to determine the primary purpose of the query
    // and estimates its complexity
}

// Helper function to calculate how well an agent's capabilities match the query intent
private func calculateCapabilityMatchScore(agent: Agent, intent: QueryIntent) -> Double {
    // Implementation details...
    // This compares the agent's capabilities against the requirements of the query
}

// Helper function to adjust score based on historical performance
private func performanceAdjustmentFactor(agent: Agent, intent: QueryIntent) -> Double {
    // Implementation details...
    // This looks at how well the agent has performed on similar queries in the past
}
```

5. Document UI components and view models:
```swift
/// A view that displays and manages the code execution interface.
///
/// `CodeExecutionView` provides a user interface for:
/// - Displaying code with syntax highlighting
/// - Running code in a sandboxed environment
/// - Showing execution status and results
/// - Handling execution errors
///
/// This view follows the AgenticSeek UI/UX Cursor Rules for code execution interfaces.
struct CodeExecutionView: View {
    /// The view model that manages the code execution state and logic.
    @ObservedObject var viewModel: CodeExecutionViewModel
    
    var body: some View {
        VStack(alignment: .leading, spacing: DesignSystem.Spacing.medium) {
            // UI implementation...
        }
    }
}

/// The view model responsible for managing code execution state and logic.
///
/// `CodeExecutionViewModel` handles:
/// - Preparing code for execution
/// - Communicating with the execution service
/// - Managing execution state
/// - Processing execution results
/// - Handling execution errors
class CodeExecutionViewModel: ObservableObject {
    /// The current code to be executed.
    @Published var code: String = ""
    
    /// The programming language of the code.
    @Published var language: CodeLanguage = .swift
    
    /// The current execution status.
    @Published var status: ExecutionStatus = .idle
    
    /// The result of the code execution, if available.
    @Published var result: String? = nil
    
    /// Any error that occurred during execution.
    @Published var error: Error? = nil
    
    /// The execution service used to run the code.
    private let executionService: CodeExecutionService
    
    /// Creates a new code execution view model.
    ///
    /// - Parameter executionService: The service used to execute code.
    init(executionService: CodeExecutionService = .shared) {
        self.executionService = executionService
    }
    
    /// Executes the current code.
    ///
    /// This method sends the code to the execution service and updates the view model's state
    /// based on the result.
    func executeCode() {
        guard !code.isEmpty else { return }
        
        status = .running
        result = nil
        error = nil
        
        executionService.execute(code: code, language: language) { [weak self] result in
            DispatchQueue.main.async {
                guard let self = self else { return }
                
                switch result {
                case .success(let output):
                    self.status = .success
                    self.result = output
                case .failure(let executionError):
                    self.status = .failure
                    self.error = executionError
                    ErrorHandlingService.shared.handle(executionError)
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

6. Create a documentation review checklist:
   - All public APIs have DocC comments
   - All parameters, return values, and throws are documented
   - Complex logic has explanatory comments
   - Business rules and non-obvious decisions are explained
   - Examples are provided where helpful
   - Documentation is clear, concise, and accurate

7. Generate and review DocC documentation:
   - Set up DocC documentation generation in the build process
   - Review generated documentation for completeness and clarity
   - Address any documentation warnings or errors

# Test Strategy:
1. Create a documentation coverage analyzer script that scans the codebase for public APIs without DocC comments.

2. Implement a CI check that fails if public APIs are missing documentation.

3. Generate DocC documentation as part of the CI pipeline and verify it builds without errors.

4. Create a documentation review process where team members review each other's documentation for clarity and completeness.

5. Test code examples in documentation to ensure they compile and work as expected.

6. Verify that documentation is accessible through Xcode's Quick Help feature by spot-checking key APIs.

7. Create a documentation style guide compliance checker that verifies documentation follows the established format and includes all required sections.

8. Implement a periodic documentation audit process to ensure documentation stays up-to-date as code evolves.
